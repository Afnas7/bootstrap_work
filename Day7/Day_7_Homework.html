<!-- Create a simple travel-themed webpage using Bootstrap. The page should include:

A sliding image banner that automatically changes pictures (like a travel destination slideshow).

A caption over each image explaining the destination.

A button labeled “Book Now”. When clicked, it should open a pop-up box with some booking details and a close button.

The popup should appear in the center of the screen and be large enough to show some details.

Add a small info icon at the bottom that shows a message when hovered over, guiding users about booking. -->
